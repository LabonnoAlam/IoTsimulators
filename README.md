# IoTsimulators

IoT-based home automation system is a simple, Java-based approach to automate and monitor household functions. This system relies solely on software without any hardware and is designed for a single room accommodating up to five people. With this tool, you can automatically regulate the AC/heater based on the number of occupants in the room. Further optimization will be achieved with the integration of hardware support into this project.
